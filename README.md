# Abstract
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) differs widely among individuals, creating challenges for accurate patient
classification and personalized treatment. Traditional clustering methods for T2DM phenotyping often
depend on single algorithms or clinic-based datasets, which limit reproducibility and generalizability.
Moreover, analyses of large-scale survey data such as US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) frequently neglect survey sampling design, introducing bias into phenotype discovery. We present
a Population-Weighted Partitioning Framework to address these limitations, integrating survey sampling
weights into the clustering process through weighted co-association matrices. Applied to NHANES data, the
framework uncovers robust, population-representative T2DM phenotypes, validated across multiple imputed
datasets, survey cycles, and regression-based outcome analyses. Comparative experiments demonstrate that
population-weighted partitioning enhances cluster stability and improves alignment with actual population
characteristics. By combining unsupervised learning with survey-aware design, this framework strengthens
methodological rigor in health data mining. It delivers a scalable, reproducible approach for precision
diabetes epidemiology in complex survey settings.
